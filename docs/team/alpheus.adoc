#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Users will want to view the list of contacts sorted for them based on their name, phone, email or address.
Some users find the contact they want by scrolling through the list as opposed to typing and this will aid them.
