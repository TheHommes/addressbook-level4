=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users will want to view the list of contacts sorted for them based on their name, phone, email or address.
Some users find the contact they want by scrolling through the list as opposed to typing and this will aid them.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: First time tutorial

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tutorial]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Currently when new users launch Bluebird for the first time, they will be lost as to what Bluebird has to offer and also what different UI panels mean.
Therefore, there is a need to provide first time users of Bluebird a step-by-step tutorial on how Bluebird works.

to search for the contact they want.

==== External behavior
